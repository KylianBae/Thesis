    "In this function meiosis has been programmed. During meiosis 2 individuals will be sampled from a population of individuals which contains diploids or diplois, triplois and tetraploids. For each of these individuals a certain amount of chromosomes will be selected to be present in the gametes which will create the following generation. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the sampled individual is diploid either 1 of the chromosomes will be selected with equal probability which will lead to reduced gametes or 2 chromosomes will be selected (unreduced gametes) according a probability 1-v for reduced gametes and v for unreduced gametes.\n",

    "In the case that the individual is triploid we would have to take into account a fertility factor ùúë which is computed to be 0.30 (Schemske). This is done by generating a random number from an uniform distribution between 0 and 1, in the case that this generated number is less then  ùúë the triploid can succesfully form gametes otherwise the triploid will not form gametes. When the triploid is able to form gametes there is 25% chance that only one chromosome is selected which would result in a haploid gamete, 25% that 2 chromsomes are selected which results in diploid gametes and 50% chance that 3 chromsomes are selected which results in triploid gametes \n",
